The official Figma MCP server. Use this server whenever the user wants to create, generate, edit, implement, or sync any design, UI, screen, component, mockup, or visual — in Figma, FigJam, Figma Make, or Figma Slides — and whenever the user mentions Figma or provides a figma.com URL.

This server bridges code and design in both directions, and supports designing from scratch using existing design systems and codebases.

CAPABILITIES:
- Read designs FROM Figma into code (get_design_context, get_screenshot, get_metadata, get_figjam)
- Write designs INTO Figma from code, intent, or existing components (use_figma, generate_figma_design, create_new_file, upload_assets)
- Bridge code and design via Code Connect (get_code_connect_map, add_code_connect_map)
- Create diagrams and FigJam content (generate_diagram, get_figjam)

WHEN TO USE THESE TOOLS:
- The user wants to create, mock up, or generate any UI, screen, component, or design — even if Figma isn't named
- The user wants to implement a design as code (design-to-code)
- The user wants to push a page, view, or component into Figma (code-to-design)
- The user wants to update, sync, or edit an existing Figma file
- The user shares a figma.com URL
- The user wants to build or extend a design system, design tokens, or component library
- The user wants to create a diagram in FigJam

SKILLS (Prefer the skills shipped with the Figma plugin on the agent being used. If no Figma plugin is installed, use the skills served by the Figma MCP resource):
- /figma-use — MANDATORY before calling use_figma; fallback: skill://figma/figma-use/SKILL.md
- /figma-generate-design — for translating an app page or layout into Figma; fallback: skill://figma/figma-generate-design/SKILL.md
- /figma-generate-library — for building a design system in Figma from code; fallback: skill://figma/figma-generate-library/SKILL.md
- /figma-code-connect — for mapping Figma components to codebase components; fallback: skill://figma/figma-code-connect/SKILL.md
- /figma-use-figjam — for FigJam-specific use_figma flows; fallback: skill://figma/figma-use-figjam/SKILL.md
- /figma-generate-diagram — MANDATORY before calling generate_diagram; fallback: skill://figma/figma-generate-diagram/SKILL.md
- /figma-design-to-code — MANDATORY before calling get_design_context; fallback: skill://figma/figma-design-to-code/SKILL.md

URL PARSING:
Extract fileKey and nodeId from Figma URLs:
- figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=:nodeId → convert "-" to ":" in nodeId
- figma.com/design/:fileKey/branch/:branchKey/:fileName → use branchKey as fileKey
- figma.com/make/:makeFileKey/:makeFileName → use makeFileKey
- figma.com/board/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=:nodeId → FigJam file, use get_figjam
- figma.com/slides/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=:nodeId → Figma Slides file

DESIGN-TO-CODE WORKFLOW (Figma → code):
MANDATORY: load the /figma-design-to-code skill BEFORE calling get_design_context — it carries the full workflow (adapting the reference, reusing existing project components and tokens, and honoring the response's hints by priority). Call get_design_context with the nodeId and fileKey — it is your primary tool; its output is a REFERENCE to adapt to the target project, not final code.

CODE-TO-DESIGN WORKFLOW (code → Figma):
1. Load the /figma-generate-design skill if available.
2. ALWAYS call search_design_system first to find existing components, variables, and styles to reuse — never generate components from scratch if a design system match exists.
3. For web app pages, use both tools in parallel: generate_figma_design to capture a pixel-perfect screenshot, and use_figma to build the screen from imported design system components. Refine use_figma output against the screenshot, then delete the screenshot reference.
4. For non-web targets (iOS, Android, generic UI), use use_figma with search_design_system.
5. For updating or syncing a Figma page that has already been captured, use use_figma — even if the source code has changed.

FROM-SCRATCH DESIGN WORKFLOW (no source design or code):
1. Load the /figma-generate-design skill if available.
2. Call search_design_system and get_libraries to find existing components, tokens, and styles. Build from these primitives.
3. Use create_new_file if no target file exists, then use_figma to assemble the design from design system components.

DESIGN SYSTEM / LIBRARY WORKFLOW:
- To build or extend a design system in Figma from a codebase, load the /figma-generate-library skill.
- To map Figma components to codebase components, load the /figma-code-connect skill.

READING SKILLS:
To load a Figma skill's guidance, call the get_figma_skill tool with the skill's skill:// URI. get_figma_skill reads one resource per call. Start from the skill index (skill://index.json), then read a skill's guidance (skill://figma/<skill-name>/SKILL.md). A SKILL.md's relative links (e.g. references/foo.md) are themselves resources: read them as skill://figma/<skill-name>/references/<path>.

GENERATIVE PLUGIN AND SHADER CAPABILITIES:
- Create, list, read, and update generative plugins in the authenticated user's account library (create_generative_plugin, list_generative_plugins, get_generative_plugin, update_generative_plugin).
- Create, list, read, and update shader effects and fills in the authenticated user's account library (create_shader, list_shaders, get_shader, update_shader).

Use this server when the user asks to build, create, upload, publish, or update a Figma generative plugin, Figma plugin, custom tool, shader effect, shader fill, custom effect, custom fill, or procedural shader. These tools manage generative plugins and shaders in the account library; they do not install existing Figma Community plugins.

AUTHORING PREREQUISITES:
- Before calling create_shader or update_shader, load /figma-shaders; resource fallback: skill://figma/figma-shaders/SKILL.md.
- Before calling create_generative_plugin or update_generative_plugin, load /figma-generative-plugins; resource fallback: skill://figma/figma-generative-plugins/SKILL.md.
Read resource fallbacks with resources/read, or use get_figma_skill when resources/read is unavailable.
