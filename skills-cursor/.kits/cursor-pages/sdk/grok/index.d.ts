/**
 * Public API for authoring `.canvas.tsx` files via `grok/canvas`.
 *
 * A canvas built with this kit is a Grok Bot page: a title, a short summary,
 * and sections of paragraphs, callouts, lists, tables, and charts. The blocks
 * are the default vocabulary, not the ceiling: `Grid` sets blocks side by
 * side, `Segmented` switches views, `LineChart` (`lines`) and `ColumnSeries`
 * carry several series with a legend and a hover detail, `Scatter` puts two
 * measures per item in a cloud of dots, `Heatmap` and `CalendarHeatmap` color
 * a matrix or a year of days on the sequential ramp, `Diagram` draws a
 * flowchart or an org chart, `Sequence` draws the messages between actors
 * down their lifelines, and any richer visual (timeline) is inline SVG
 * or divs colored from
 * `useGrokTheme()` (`dataviz` for data marks, neutral `text` for every label,
 * type scale). A page has one width, set on the `Page`: the reading column
 * for a write-up, `wide` or `full` for a dashboard, a wide table, a board, or
 * a diagram, and every block shares it. It always looks like Grok and
 * follows the viewer's light/dark mode. A page is a document only its author
 * updates: a `Checklist` or `Checkbox` shows recorded status and takes no
 * input from the viewer, while `Segmented`, `Toggle`, `Select`, `Input`, and
 * `Button` are view controls the reader may operate to change what is shown,
 * never what is recorded. Wrap the canvas in one `Page`, take colors and
 * fonts from the theme, and give the `Page` a `palette` when the person asks
 * for their own series colors.
 */
/**
 * React authoring utilities re-exported so canvases need one public import:
 * the hooks and the event, node, and style types a page's handlers and
 * helpers are typed with. A name missing here fails the canvas type check,
 * so the list covers what authors reach for, not only what the blocks use.
